We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

[sudo] password for maildeliverer: 
Sorry, user maildeliverer may not run sudo on Delivery.



maildeliverer@Delivery:~$ sudo -i
[sudo] password for maildeliverer: 
maildeliverer is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
